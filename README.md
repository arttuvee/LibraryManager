## This is the project repository for LibraryManager application

The application allows users to reserve various books, movies, and games, as well as access information about the return policy. If items are returned late, users may receive an invoice. To access the service, users are required to create an account, which they will use to log in and manage their reservations and returns. Without an account, it is not possible to use the application.

Additionally, the admin has the ability to monitor the inventory of books, movies, and games. When creating an account, users are also asked to provide their age, as some movies and games are rated 18+, ensuring content is suitable based on age restrictions.

The application interface was developed using JavaFX, and the software was programmed in Java with CSS used for styling.

To use the application you need to connect to Metropolia VPN after that you start the application by running the code.
