## This is the project repository for LibraryManager application

The application includes reserving different books as well as their return policy. If you return them late, you may receive an invoice. Users need to create an account, which they can use to log in in the future. The admin can see the books in stock and other details. Users are also asked for their age, as some movies and games are rated 18+.
